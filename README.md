# Scrumdinger

This application is designed to efficiently and systematically organize meetings. The app features a timer that manages speakers and also transcribes all spoken content during the meeting into text. In this project, I applied knowledge of SwiftUI, information transfer between views, the functionalities introduced in iOS 17, and the creation of views.

## FAQ

#### Can I use it for my daily meeting?

Sure you can! The app was made for helping the meeting's hosts to control and be focused in each speaker, that is why it has a built in text-to-speech function.

#### Is it able to save what the speakers said during their speech?

Yes!  Each meeting's history saves the transcription for every word said.

#### Can I customize it with the color of my preference?

Of course you can! Before creating a meeting you will be able to choose the color of your preference.
